# Task 

Using the `launches` data, the `arrange()` verb, and the `head()` verb: 

- Print the earliest launches

```{r}
launches %>% 
  arrange(launch_date) %>% 
  head()
```

- Still using the head verb, use the `desec()` adverb to print the *most recent* launches

```{r}

```

Adding in the `state_code` variable, 

- Arrange the data so that it is sorted first by `launch_year` and then by `state_code`

```{r}

```
