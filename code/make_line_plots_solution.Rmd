# Squirrels by date 

- Make a line plot that shows the squirrels observed by date

```{r}
squirrel_subset %>%
  group_by(date_f) %>%
  summarise(count_of_squirrels = n()) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = date_f, y = count_of_squirrels) +
  geom_line()
```

# Challenge: Squirrels by color by date

```{r}
squirrel_subset %>%
  group_by(date_f, primary_fur_color) %>%
  summarise(count_of_squirrels = n()) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = date_f, y = count_of_squirrels, color = primary_fur_color) +
  geom_line()
```
