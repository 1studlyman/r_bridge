# Task 

- Using the `launches` data, count the total number of launches per `launch_year`, grouped by `state_code`. 
- Then, using `arrange` answer the question: which year was the busiest for any state? 
- Then, using `filter` answer the question: what was the busiest year for the US? 
- Then, using another variable summary, answer the question: which country has the most variance in the per-year launches?
