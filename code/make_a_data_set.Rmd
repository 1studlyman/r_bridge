# Paste Farm Code 

Start by pasting the code that you wrote to create the farm animals below. 

```{r}
'farm animal creating code here' 
```

## Combine into a dataset 

Now, combine all of these variables into a single dataset, called `tilden`. 

## Typecast 

Now do a little bit of mutating and type converting. 

- Since we know that each of the types of animals has a specific amount that they eat, let's label them "hungry boi" if they eat more than average; and "slender boi" if they eat less than average. (Sorry... I know this coding might be getting tedious!). 
- Make each of these relative to the mean within that animal type. 

```{r}

```
