# A Demo Repository 

Welcome! This is a demo repository for the R Bridge Course. A repository is a file system that you can maintain. You're free to work with this repository in any way that you see fit. As a note, this is a public repository, so your peers and classmates also have access to it, and will be puling it to their machines. 

# Your Contributions 

We would love your thoughts about what might be usefully put in this demo repo. **But even more** we would love your contributions! Issue a PR! You can put links to student resources for learning about github in the section below if you like, or wherever you think makes the most sense. 

# Main Task 

1. Create a document that has the form `year_semester_yourname.md`. 
2. Inside this document, write about a recent trip to the grocery store or market, and the thing that you bought you were the *most* excited about. 

# Student resources for learning about git and GitHub.
