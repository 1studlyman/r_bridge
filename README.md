# A Demo Repository 

Welcome! This is the course repository for the R Bridge course. This course is a non-graded, introductory course that we have built for students who are beginning the Masters of Information and Data Science program in the UC Berkeley School of Information. 

# Class Resources 

The class works closely from [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz "r4ds") to prepare students for the theoretical and applied work. We recommend the course for students preparing to take *Statistics for Data Scientists* (w203); but the course might also be a useful refresher for students who are taking *Experiments and Causal Inference* (w241) and *Statistical Methods for Discrete Rseponse, Time Series, and Panel Data* (w271). 

As a bridge course, this course is distinct from the main course offerings of the School of Information -- there are no syncronous discussion sections, and there are no graded assessments. Instead, this is a self-paced course of study designed to be completed in roughly a week before beginning a credit-bearing course.
