# Demo of Project Outcomes 

This is the first semester that MIDS 1C has been in existence, and so there aren't any outcomes to demo just yet. 

However, if you work on a project, and you want to show it off for people in the future, let me know (@alex.h). What I'll do is bring in your knitted .md file and link it on this page. 

I really, really, really encourage you to share your code, because showing people what all kinds of good, bad, and ugly look like is useful. Plus, it will be a fun record to look back on when you're graduating.
