# Joins and Merges 

There's a maxim: 

> If the data were easy to have, someone would have already done it!

Bringing data together from multiple sources, finding the common keys between the data, and arranging things so that they are ready to use is, at different points: fun, tedious, rewarding, and frustrating.

Please, read the [R For Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html) chapter on relational data for merging. There is a lot covered in this chapter so, let me provide you an edited list (in case you don't want to read it all). 

- Read: 13.1 Introduction
- Read: 13.1.1 Prerequisites -- and, in fact, log on to teh datahub and load the data so that you can read and type along. 
- Read: 13.2 and 13.3, but skip the exercises
- Read: 13.4; and, do the exercises for 13.4.6
- Read: 13.5, but skip the exercises in 13.5.1
- Read: 13.6
- **Skip** 13.7
