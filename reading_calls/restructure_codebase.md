# Reading about codebase structure 

Rather than restructuring a codebase, this semester I'd like you to read about how Cookiecutter data science thinks that a project might be structured.

While I think that this is a starting place, it is overkill for small projects. As you come into w203, and in particular the _Hypothesis Testing_ and _Final Lab_ this structure will help you to be able to build a working pipeline that builds toward clean data that you can write clean tests on.
