# Goals of the Project 

If you're going to take on a small project here are the goals that I think might help you to scope it: 

1. The data should already be collected 
2. The data should be in one, or maybe two files
3. If there is a time component to the data, then your key insight should be a plot for how simple values of the data change over time; 
4. If there is not a time component to the data, then your key insight should be how different categories that are represented in the data have different values on the outcomes that you care about. 

# Where to Get Data 

- I've pointed to Tidy Tuesday (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) before as a nice place to get data. In fact, that is where both the squirrels and space launches data came from. But, a lot of students will probably end up using data from there. 
- Another good option is the #datasets channel in the School's Slack channel. 
- Also a good bet are the New York Times, LA Times, Wall Street Journal, and Economist github pages.
