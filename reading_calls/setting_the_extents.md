# Setting the Extents 

Setting the plot extents is one of the strangest things within the `ggplot` plotting idiom. 

As we've noted in lecture, there are two options: 

1. `coord_cartesian()`
2. `lims()` 

Rather than taking the time to code these at this point, just keep in mind that there are two options. If, in the future you're setting the extents and get an error message that some data has been dropped, `ggplot` will also let you know what the alternative is.
