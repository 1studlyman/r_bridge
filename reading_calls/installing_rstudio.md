# Installing Rstudio Locally 

(This is a step that you only need to take if you're going to install locally!)

Rstudio is available to install at https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/.

Rstudio is the IDE that we're advocating folks use while writing code in the R language. 

- It is probably the defacto editor for the language; 
- It provides a lot of really, really useful functionality that is specific to statistical computing, and is actively maintained and developed on. 

Like a local install of R, if you install on your local machine you'll have total control over what is available to you. But you'll also have to build everything that you want to be available. 

Whether you use the UCB Datahub, build this with a Docker image, or install locally, Rstudio does a _very_ good job of trying to make things "just work". This means that if you have code that requires a new package, it will suggest the install for that package; if you need to change you install of R it will suggest the install; and it has **enormously&** helpful help documentation. 

(Remember, you only need to install R and Rstudio if you're installing them locally. If you're going to use a resource that we've provided, you don't have to install.)

Best of luck!
