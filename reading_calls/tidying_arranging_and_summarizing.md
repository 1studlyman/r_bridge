# Tidying, Arranging, and Summarizing 

We're now to the point that we're going to really start working with data. Until this point, I've basically provided you with the data in the form that you need it. 

But tidying, arranging, and summarizing data is **so** core to many of the tasks that we work on. 

In this section we're going to start a series of really quick loops between a lecture on a concept and a short coding exercise that uses that concept. 

# Reading Task 

To begin please read the following chapter in *R For Data Science*. 

- If you're reading the hard copy, the chapter is **Chapter 5: Exploratory Data Analysis**
- If you're reading the digital copy it is **Chapter 7: Exploratory Data Analysis** and you can get to it [at this link](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html). 

As you're reading along, try to think of each new concept that comes in as a **verb** that _does_ something to data. The idea within the `dplyr` framework is that data **is** and we as data scientists do things to modify the canonical source data.
