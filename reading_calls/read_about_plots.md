# Read About Plots 

Please read in the Book _R For Data Science_ 

- If you are reading from the pyhsical copy of the book, please read pages 1-13.  
- If you are reading from the [digital copy](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/explore-intro.html) of the book, please read 
    - 2: Introduction
    - 3: Data visualization sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 stopping before the section 3.5 "facets". 
    
This reading is the same (at least as of the time that we've made the course available). For this content, because the language is changing, I actually think that reading the online (digital) version of the resource is a better idea (although I read from a physical copy of the book). 

As you're reading, you can follow along and execute the code that the authors are talking about in your DataHub, if you like. Consider this, perhaps by making a new file, and writing the code, executing, and reading the output.
