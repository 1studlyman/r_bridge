# But Here's the thing 

Look, here's the thing. For some reason people are almost **universally** bashful about sharing their code with others. 

- No really, even though there is  some sort of silly taboo against talking about salary (which I think is put in place to keep workers from demanding higher wages and fuller benefits from management... ok, politics aside...) I bet that if we randomly paired a group of people in the class together, they'd rather talk about salary than have to defend why they coded the last exercise the way they did. 

- Just don't worry about it. 

Code, like salaries works better when we can all see how others have approached something, asking why, and coming to a mutual understanding. 

Here's some guidance from David Robinson (formerly with Stack Exchange) and Hadly Wickham (who literally re-wrote the language in the idiom that we're using):

> This is exactly how you end up with crises of reproducible research in science. There are many reasons scientists publish papers without sharing their code (none of them defensible), but high on the list is embarrassment: “my code is too ugly to share.” Code shamers aren’t helping!
