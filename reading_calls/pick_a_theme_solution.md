# Pick a Theme Solution 

There isn't really a **solution*** to this, and up until this point in the course we've been using my favorite theme -- `theme_minimal()`. 

I like that it uses a san-serif font in the plot; that it doesn't use more ink than it needs to, and that the grid lines that are internal to the plot are muted. 

Plot on! :metal:
