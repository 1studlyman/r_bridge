The good folks over at RStudio make a [coding style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org "style_guide") available. Just like all style guides, it is an opinonated resource, but their opinions are pretty reasonable! 

Take a gander at the following sections: 1-5 in the Style Guide. 

I like to think of code as craft: 

- Maybe you're careful about how you make your coffee; or, 
- How you cut your vegitables; 
- How you park your car; 
- How you do your hair

There is something in your life that you take satisfaction in doing well. That's why you're here! Writing elegant code _can_ be one of those. But, as you're going to read in the **next** section, please don't let the perfect be the enemy of the "it works". 

I write python code with an R accent. I write R code with an "old person" accent. But, I'm learning new things every day.
