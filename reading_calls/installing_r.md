R is available to install at https://cran.r-project.org. 

Installing locally will mean 

- That you get access to full resources on your local machine
- That you have to manage the access to all of those resources
- That your setup will be different than everyone else's setup

While we still stand by the "don't solve a problem that you don't have" mantra; installing locally will probably incur some technical debt later on down the line. 

As an example, many of the high-performance parts of the language use specific C compilers. In the future, if you want to use these tools, you'll have to back-step to install the specific compilers, and then ensure that the rest of what you've built will still work. 

If you choose to go this way, best of luck!
