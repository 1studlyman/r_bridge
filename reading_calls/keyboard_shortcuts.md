There is a really great set of resources that the Rstudio team maintains that are a serires of [one-page cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).

Particularily relevant at this point is the cheatsheet that describes how to interact with the [Rstudio IDE](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf). We have also saved a frozen copy of this cheatsheet in the course repo (./resources/cheatsheet-rstudio_ide.pdf).
