# Alternatives to Rstudio 

Just as jupyter has been the standard method of working with python for data science, Rstudio has emerged as the standard editor of working with R for data science. However, Rstudio is far from the only option. 

Of particular note for alternatives: 

- Emacs users will be **smugly** satisfied that ESS was purpose built for interactive programming in R. It is very, very good if you want to use a general purpose editor for writing your R code. 
- Microsoftâ€™s VSCode has several really impressive extensions for working with the language as well. That isn't too surprising, because the primary development of the R language is now underwritten in part by Microsoft.
