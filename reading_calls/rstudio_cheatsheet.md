# R Markdown Cheatsheet 

Return to the cheatsheet resource that Rstudio maintains. 

- The top-level repository with the cheatsheets is [here](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/); and, 
- The cheatsheet that is specifically useful right now is the [Rmarkdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf). (Note, this link might download a PDF when you click it.)  

This cheatsheet is something that you might want to have around when you're producing document and work for w203. 

For now, if you're interseted in seeing how the expanded set of options available to you work, navigate to the UCB Datahub, head to the code folder, and open `make_scatter_plots_solution.Rmd`. 

There is nothing _particularily_ special about this file, but try to see if you can use the Datahub to output the solutions into different formats by changing the `output:` call in the YAML and re-knitting. See what happens if you insert new chunks, or change options that are passed into chunks.
