# Schedule 

This course is designed so that students can complete the *incoming*, structured work in four, two-hours long study sessions. (Or thereabouts.) The materials are structured as follows: 

1. **Install Dependencies** - Get a working system going, and start to navigate the language. Because we advocate that you use a deployed environment hosted by UC Berkeley, this module can be completed in as few as 30 minutes. The student interested in building a version of the compute environment on their own machine will be walked through a Docker install.
2. **Thinking About Data** - "What information is encoded in my data, and how can I start to explore this information?" This module introduces plotting highly structured data by introducing the grammar of graphics. 
3. **Plotting and Manipulating Data** - This module expands students' expressiveness when moving data into plots and introduces core concepts in data manipulation. The student is still firmly grounded in a data.frame. 
4. **Working at the Project Level** - This module takes the student outside of the dataframe, both looking more broadly at structuring a project workflow and more narrowly at lower-level pieces of the `R` language. 
5. **Sharing a Project** - This module sets the student out to work on a tightly-scoped project.
