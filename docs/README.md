# R Bridge Course

Welcome! This is the course repository for the R Bridge course. This course is a non-graded, introductory course that we have built for students who are beginning the Masters of Information and Data Science program in the UC Berkeley School of Information. 

# Schedule 

This course is designed so that students can complete the *incoming*, structured work in four, two-hours long study sessions. (Or thereabouts.) The materials are structured as follows: 

1. **Install Dependencies** - Get a working system going, and start to navigate the language. Because we advocate that you use a deployed environment hosted by UC Berkeley, this module can be completed in as few as 30 minutes. The student interested in building a version of the compute environment on their own machine will be walked through a Docker install.
2. **Thinking About Data** - "What information is encoded in my data, and how can I start to explore this information?" This module introduces plotting highly structured data by introducing the grammar of graphics. 
3. **Plotting and Manipulating Data** - This module expands students' expressiveness when moving data into plots and introduces core concepts in data manipulation. The student is still firmly grounded in a data.frame. 
4. **Working at the Project Level** - This module takes the student outside of the dataframe, both looking more broadly at structuring a project workflow and more narrowly at lower-level pieces of the `R` language. 
5. **Sharing a Project** - This module sets the student out to work on a tightly-scoped project. 

# Course Syllabus 



As a bridge course, this course is distinct from the main course offerings of the School of Information -- there are no syncronous discussion sections, and there are no graded assessments. Instead, this is a self-paced course of study designed to be completed in roughly a week before beginning a credit-bearing course. 

The class works closely from [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz "r4ds") to prepare students for the theoretical and applied work. We recommend the course for students preparing to take *Statistics for Data Scientists* (w203); but the course might also be a useful refresher for students who are taking *Experiments and Causal Inference* (w241) and *Statistical Methods for Discrete Rseponse, Time Series, and Panel Data* (w271). 

In contrast to many methods of learning new languages, this course focuses on working with high-level parts of the language -- namely plotting (from `ggplot2`) and data manipulation (from `dplyr`) before addressing lower-level parts of the language. Indeed, this course is at an even higher-level part of the langauge api than the *R for Data Science* textbook. 

I (Alex) made this choice deliberately, based on a model of spoken language-learning: When learning a new language, we try to build concepts and vocabulary, even if this means that we conjugate verbs incorrectly or use inefficient methods of expressing ourselves. Often times, coding-language-learning tries to approach their language as though there is some axomatic truth from which the language is derived. These "truths" are enshrined in style guides, deployed code, and bravado; but they hide a more important truth -- just start communicating and see what you can get done. 

You can probably nagivate a busy market and appreciate the culture in a foreign land where you don't speak the language. Similarily, you can probably write clumsy code that expresses your intent and learn from your data. Just start writing and learning; we'll speak fluently soon enough.
